My mom and I work well together, but not well enough to sit beside each other. We differ in many ways, but we share a common obsession with word games. The Washington Post and the New Yorker have an online “collaboration” feature allowing my mom and me to work together from a distance. Sometimes I wish we had the patience to sit together, working on one computer, but I also love dividing and conquering, filling in each box with a letter.
